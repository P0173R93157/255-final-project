CMSC 255 Final Project

# TODO
Whatâ€™s due Thursday: 

* The task we want to accomplish
* The algorithm for the task
* Project plan with dates and times and locations where we will work and meet and what we want to accomplish 
* And finally the performance rubric

# GitHub Crash Course
## Linux/Unix Terminal Commands

1. You're probably going to want the repository downloaded to your computer.
CMD: git clone https://github.com/P0173R93157/255-final-project.git

2. Now that you have the respository on your computer, CONGRATS! You can now start editing the code.

You probably will want to save that code to the repository at some point. Here is how to propose a change.

CMD: (Use this to add/remove any files) git add *

CMD: (Use this to send those changes to GitHub) commit -am "(Insert information about changes here)"

P.S. This is where merging comes into play if you changed a file in a different way than expected.

If this happens, ping me and I can walk you through it

3. I can filter through the commits to PUSH them to the master branch as the optimal code for the project.

## Windows Terminal Commands

I don't use Windows... Please reference the next section if you wish to make changes... Sorry...

## On the GitHub homepage buttons to press

1. Refer to the green button in the top right that says "Clone or download"

2. Click it and then click "Download Zip". This should save the repository to your Downlaods folder

3. Move the zip file to where you want to store the repository and then unpack it

4. You can make changes locally on your machine, or you can make changes on GitHub itself.

5a. (Assuming you chose to edit on the website) Click on the file you wish to edit, you should see a pencil icon in the top right of the window, give it a click

6a. This will open an editor for you to make changes, go to town on that code!

7a. When you want to save your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the green button that says "Commit changes"

8a. (Optional) You can add a description about what changes you made in the commit changes box above the green "Commit changes" button

5b. (To Be Continued...)

P.S. Let me know if you want to know how to edit files locally and I'll update the guide.
